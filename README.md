## General Information

This project follow the following steps

- Loading the data and doing initial analysis to understand that there are no missing values
- divide the variables into categorical and numeric variables
- do exploratory data analysis to understand the data
- conevert the categorical variables to dummy variables
- splt the data into train and test set
- scale the numeric variableds
- build a coars grain model by using REF
- fine tune the model by using statsmodel with the help of p-value and VIF
- do a residual analysis on the data
- and finally run the model on the test set and find out the r-squared value

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions

To predict the demand the following variables are important

- temp
- year
- const
- Sun
- workingday
- s_mist
- s_spring
- s_light_rain

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- statsmodel
- sklearn

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
